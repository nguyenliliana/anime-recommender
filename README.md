#Anime Recommender#

Recommends random anime that have a rating greater than six with each button click for adventurous anime watchers.
Built with Flask, Python, and HTML/CSS and utilizes Jikan API to retrieve information such as title, synopsis, rating, and images from MyAnimeList.

I am interested in Full Stack Development, so I wanted to do a project involving APIs and code the whole project by myself front to back.  I have many friends who love watching animes, so I decided to make a fun Anime Recommender website.  With this project, I learned Python using online resources to fetch anime data from the Jikan API, and I learned Flask to deploy a functional website. Flask was surprisingly easy to pick up and my previous experience with HTML/CSS allowed me to complete the website quickly.
